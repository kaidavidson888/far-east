# Far East — instructions for Claude Code

Read HANDOFF.md first for the full story. This file is the short operating manual.

## What this is
A cigarette catalogue and review site. **Every score comes from readers; there is no
editorial rating.** Browsing, reviews, ratings and shared shelves are readable with no
account. An account adds rating, reviewing, and a shelf shareable by snapshot link.
Design system: `DESIGN-far-east.md` (brand spec supplied by the owner — follow it).

## Stack
Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · Supabase Postgres via `postgres.js` (hand-written SQL,
NOT PostgREST) · Supabase Auth via `@supabase/ssr` · Server Actions for every mutation ·
no CSS framework (tokens in `app/globals.css`). Deploys to Vercel.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — local server (needs `.env.local`, see below)
- `npm run build` — must stay clean; run it before every commit
- `npm run build:landing` / `npm run build:pages` — normalise a page's artwork and cut it
  into `public/<page>/parts/*.svg` + `lib/<page>-geometry.json`. `build:pages` does About Us,
  Privacy Policy and Terms of Service together. Re-run after changing the matching
  `scripts/assets/*.svg`; the layouts read that geometry, so nothing is hardcoded and a
  re-export moves the buttons with the marks. See "Pages built from artwork" below.
- `npm run verify:db` — 29 checks against a throwaway Postgres (no network, no Supabase). Run after any schema or `lib/db.ts` change. It boots its own Postgres via `embedded-postgres`.
- `npm run seed` — upserts `lib/catalog.json` into the database (idempotent; never touches user data)
- `npm run link-supabase` / `set-db-password` / `diagnose-db` — configure `.env.local` safely (hidden prompts, connection tested before saving, refuse piped input)
- `npm run demo` — three sample accounts, LOCAL ONLY; needs the secret key

## Environment (`.env.local`, gitignored — never commit, never paste into chat)
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`.
`DATABASE_URL` must be the **transaction pooler on port 6543** (serverless exhausts direct
connections). Set values with the scripts above, not by hand-editing — a stale TextEdit buffer
overwrote this file twice during setup. `.env.example` is the template.

## Invariants — do not break these
- **Ownership is enforced in SQL, not RLS.** The app connects as the DB owner and bypasses RLS,
  so every mutation in `lib/db.ts` is scoped by `user_id` in the query. Dropping a
  `WHERE user_id = ...` exposes other people's data with nothing to catch it.
- **RLS is ON for every table, with a policy only on `cigarettes`.** Supabase exposes `public`
  tables via PostgREST with the browser-visible key; this denies that by default. The Data API is
  also disabled in the project. If you add client-side Supabase queries they return nothing until
  you write policies — that is deliberate, not a bug.
- **Row ids are numbers.** Postgres returns `bigint` as strings by default; `lib/db.ts` parses
  int8 to Number and `hydrate()` coerces `id`. Ids are used as Map keys and compared with `===`;
  a string id silently makes shelves render empty. `verify:db` guards this.
- **A share link is a frozen snapshot** (`shares` + `share_items`) of the shelf at generation
  time, including the owner's rating and note. One live link per user (partial unique index).
  Cancelling soft-revokes (`revoked_at`); a cancelled link renders "no longer active", never 404.
- **`slug` is permanent identity.** Reviews and favourites reference the product row; changing
  a slug in `lib/catalog.json` creates a new product and orphans its data.
- **Design rules from the spec:** border-radius 0 everywhere except icon buttons/avatars; scores
  are never colour-graded; red (`--negative`) is never an error colour — it is warm grey.
  Exception the owner chose: cinnabar is also the "Add to my shelf" CTA (the primary action).
- Dates are formatted server-side in `lib/format.ts` (`en-US`, `America/New_York`) and passed
  as strings — never re-format on the client.

## Pages built from artwork (the landing page, About Us, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
The owner supplies a Figma export; the page is built from it, not hand-typeset. **The rule
the owner set: hold the design's edge margins in real CSS pixels at every viewport size.**
Elements keep their drawn size and the space between them flexes. Never scale the whole
artwork to fit a frame — that scales the margins with it, which is the thing being avoided.
- Measure margins off a *render* of the export, never off Figma layer boxes; those are
  padded (the landing logo's was a 116x116 rect mostly empty around the characters).
- `scripts/lib/split-svg-parts.mjs` cuts an export into one SVG per element, given a
  `regions` map and the page's `background`. Nodes are grouped by where they sit, not by
  index. A node matching no region, matching two, or a region catching nothing is a **hard
  error** — a silently missing mark is worse than a failed build.
- `scripts/lib/resample-embedded.mjs` brings embedded rasters down to 4x their drawn size.
  Figma exports images at full resolution: the footer icons were 46x oversampled, 640KB for
  three 54px squares. **Tune it in Chrome, never in a headless rasteriser** — resvg
  resamples far better than a browser, so it rates the untouched bitmap best and every
  re-encode a loss, which is the opposite of what ships. That mistake cost two rounds.
- `scripts/lib/page-pipeline.mjs` is the shared normalising step for the three inner pages:
  masks into defs, the logo and the "about us" label swapped for vector, footer fills set
  (the current page's button black, the other two red, label drawn after the fill), colours
  snapped. `scripts/build-pages.mjs` holds one config per page.
- **Watch for duplicated layers.** The Terms of Service export stacks two copies of its whole
  footer. Anything that rewrites an image must group by image id first, or the second pass
  measures against what the first already shrank (a 168px icon became 15px).
- `lib/artpage.ts` holds the shared layout model, `components/ArtworkPage.tsx` renders a
  spec, `lib/innerPage.ts` builds the spec the three inner pages share, and each page
  contributes one (`lib/landing.ts`, `lib/about.ts`, `lib/privacy.ts`, `lib/terms.ts`) from
  its generated geometry. CSS lives in the `.artpage-*` block in `globals.css`.
- Small labels: a 9px line of text will not render solid at DPR 1 whatever the format. Prefer
  a real vector of the label; a hairline stroke on its paths is the honest last resort.
- The form factor is resolved server-side in `lib/device.ts` so the page arrives already
  arranged. Mobile and desktop are separate placement tables even when the values match,
  so either can be re-composed alone.
- Dev flags on these pages: `?hitboxes=1` outlines the buttons, `?device=mobile|desktop`
  forces an arrangement.

## Working as a team (two people, two Claude Code sessions)
The repo is **public** on GitHub — chosen so Vercel Hobby deploys commits from either owner.
That means: **never commit anything sensitive** (`.env*` is gitignored; keep it that way), and
the brand assets and review text in this repo are visible to anyone.
- `git pull` before starting any work; commit small; push when a piece is done.
- Anything non-trivial goes on a short-lived branch and is merged by pull request. Prefer the
  other person merging. Don't force-push `main`.
- **Schema changes:** add a numbered file to `supabase/migrations/`, run `npm run verify:db`,
  and apply it to the shared Supabase project **once** (the author does it, in the SQL Editor).
  Say so in the PR. Never edit an already-applied migration; add a new one.
- `lib/catalog.json` + `npm run seed` is the catalogue's source of truth. Seeding is idempotent,
  so either person can run it after pulling.
- **This file is shared memory.** Both Claude Code sessions read it and nothing else carries
  over between them. When you learn something the other person's Claude needs — a decision,
  a gotcha, a changed invariant — put it here in the same commit as the work.
- Commit as yourself. No identity workarounds are needed now that the repo is public.

## Known gaps / open work (priority order)
1. **Deploy is not yet green.** See HANDOFF.md → Deployment. The middleware was removed to get
   past `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`; that commit (`f6b03ff`) still needs pushing.
2. **No session refresh on plain page loads** (middleware removed). Readers who only browse are
   signed out ~1h after login; server actions keep active sessions alive. Fix: a Node-runtime
   route handler (`/auth/refresh`) that calls `getUser()` and persists cookies, pinged from a
   tiny client component near token expiry. Plan is in `lib/supabase/server.ts`.
3. **Product images are a placeholder** (`components/PackShot.tsx`). Plan: `public/products/<slug>.jpg`,
   card uses it when present, falls back to the SVG. See HANDOFF.md.
4. **Real product data pending** — owner has `import/catalog-template.csv`; write an importer
   (CSV → `lib/catalog.json` → `npm run seed`). Four columns are constrained to the filter
   values in `lib/seed.ts`.
5. **Instagram link is a placeholder** — two constants at the top of `app/page.tsx`.
6. `subscribers` table is unused (newsletter removed); drop it in a migration when convenient.

## Gotchas learned the hard way
- Run `next build` only with the dev server stopped; both write to `.next`. If you need
  the pre-commit build while someone's dev server is up, `NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-build npm run
  build` sends it elsewhere — but Next rewrites `tsconfig.json` and `next-env.d.ts` to point
  at that directory, so `git checkout --` both afterwards.
- Restarting the dev server invalidates Server Action ids in open tabs → `POST 404`; hard-refresh.
- Vercel Hobby blocked deploys authored by a non-owner while the repo was private; the repo was
  made public to remove that constraint. If it is ever made private again, that returns.
- `far-east.vercel.app` is NOT this project (someone else's site). Production is `far-east-beta.vercel.app`.
- If the live domain serves `/logos/*.svg` (200) but `/` and `/_next/static/*` are 404, the
  Vercel project's Framework Preset is not "Next.js" — it is serving `public/` as a static site.
- Verifying signed-in UI: `.verify/temp-user.mjs` creates a throwaway auth user directly in
  Postgres (then `delete`). Never use real credentials for tests; the tools refuse piped input.
